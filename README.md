# Pet Finder

Pet Finder is an Android application developed as part of the final lab assignment in the course Mobile Applications and Wireless Networks during my final year of my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. This project was written in Kotlin and designed to address a common problem: helping people who have lost or found a pet.

### The Problem

Today, many people rely heavily on Facebook groups or other social media platforms to reconnect lost pets with their owners. While these platforms are widely used, they can often be inefficient, unorganized, and overwhelming due to the sheer volume of unrelated posts. Pet Finder aims to solve this problem by offering a dedicated platform tailored specifically for lost and found pets.

### Features

- Post Management: Users can create and view posts for lost or found pets, with details such as location and description.
- Image Search: Integrates a custom-trained ML model to search for pets based on uploaded images.
- Manual Filtering: Advanced filtering options to refine search results based on location, type of pet, and other criteria.
  
### Technology Stack

- Android Development: Built using Kotlin.
- Backend: Firebase for database and storage.
- APIs:
  - Firebase APIs for real-time database and cloud storage.
  - Android Developers Camera and Photo Picker APIs for capturing and selecting images.
  - TensorFlow Lite for image search functionality.
- Machine Learning: The image search functionality is powered by a custom-trained ML model, developed in Python.
