# Pet Finder Android App

Final lab assignment in the course Mobile Applications and Wireless Networks, taken during my final year of my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. The assignent consisted of developing a mobile application that solves a problem, written in Kotlin. Pet Finder is an Android app that connects people who either lost or have found a pet. It allows for posts to be uploaded, as well as image search through a custom trained ML model and manual filtering.
